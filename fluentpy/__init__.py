# This library is principally created for python 3. However python 2 support may be doable and is welcomed.


"""
To use this module just import it with a short custom name. I recommend:

    >>> import fluentpy as _ # for scripts / projects that don't use gettext
    >>> import fluentpy as _f # for everything else

If you want / need this to be less magical, you can import the main wrapper normally

    >>> from fluentpy import wrap # or `_`, if you're not using gettext

Then to use the module, wrap any value and start chaining off of it. To get started 
lets try to inrospect `fluentpy` using its own fluent interface::

    $ python3 -m fluentpy '_(_).dir().print()'
    $ python3 -m fluentpy '_(_).help()'

This is incidentally the second way to use this module, as a helper that makes it easier to 
write short shell filters quickly in python.::

    $ echo "foo\\nbar\\nbaz" \\
        | python3 -m fluentpy "lib.sys.stdin.readlines().map(each.call.upper()).map(print)"

Try to rewrite that in classical python (as a one line shell filter) and see which version spells out what happens in 
which order more clearly.

For further documentation and development see this documentation or the source at https://github.com/dwt/fluent
